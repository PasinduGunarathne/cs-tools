-- Renamed from 0190_pending_verification_rls.sql, a 4-digit NNNN_*.sql file
-- that should never have carried this content. Every CREATE POLICY here
-- calls is_project_member(...), which is only defined in this dedicated
-- 1NNNNN_*.sql RLS track (first in 100002_case_escalation_rls.sql) -- it was
-- the only 4-digit migration in the whole repository that referenced that
-- function. The Makefile's migrate target runs every 4-digit file (phase 1)
-- before any 1NNNNN file (phase 2, this track), so on a genuinely fresh
-- database the original 0190 name would have failed outright with "function
-- is_project_member(...) does not exist" -- it only happened to work in
-- practice because every environment this was tested against already had
-- is_project_member from an earlier deploy. See the top-level CLAUDE.md's
-- "RLS migration track" section for why this content belongs in this
-- number space, not the one it shipped under.
--
-- One transaction, and every CREATE POLICY preceded by its own DROP POLICY
-- IF EXISTS, matching every other file in this track -- Postgres has no
-- CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS, and this is what makes the rename itself (and
-- any future re-run) idempotent.
--
-- pending_verification has no project_id of its own -- it reaches one only
-- via work_item_id, exactly the same shape as case_attachment/work_item_tag/
-- work_item_watcher/work_item_activity (migration 100008_case_adjacent_rls.sql),
-- all of which already got this treatment. pending_verification was the one
-- table of this exact shape that never did -- a gap this migration closes,
-- not a new design.
--
-- Before this, none of POST /pending-verifications, POST /pending-verifications/
-- search, or PATCH /pending-verifications/{id} had any project-membership
-- enforcement of their own: Search was only ever incidentally safe because
-- its queries happen to join work_item (itself RLS-protected since
-- 100008_case_adjacent_rls.sql); Verify's bare `UPDATE pending_verification
-- ... WHERE id = $1` never joined work_item at all, so RLS never entered
-- into it; Create's only check was the work_item_id foreign key, and
-- Postgres foreign-key enforcement always bypasses RLS by design (it would
-- otherwise leak the existence of rows the caller can't see). Confirmed
-- live: a bare UPDATE against this table with no caller identity set
-- returned every row regardless of project.
--
-- No Go changes are needed for Search/Verify: pending_verification_repo.go
-- already runs on *Scoped (converted when this lint test was first added --
-- see TestRLSBypassLint_NoRawPoolAgainstAProtectedTable), which stamps
-- app.is_internal/app.viewer_email/app.viewer_project_ids on every query it
-- makes, regardless of which table. These policies start applying the moment
-- this migration runs, with zero code deployment required alongside it.
-- Create's own error handling does need one addition -- see the matching
-- change in pending_verification_repo.go's Create for why (a WITH CHECK
-- violation is a distinct error shape from the existing foreign-key check).
