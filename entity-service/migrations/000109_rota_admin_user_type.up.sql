-- A rota admin is internal staff, so recompute_user_type() has to say so.
--
-- Without this the feature does not work at all, and fails in a way that looks
-- like something else: recompute_user_type() (000007) derives INTERNAL from
-- the names 'admin' and 'internal' only, and anything it does not recognise
-- falls through to NOT_AVAILABLE. The schedule's own requireInternalCaller
-- refuses a NOT_AVAILABLE caller with a 403 before it ever asks whether they
-- may edit this team -- so granting cre_rota_admin to somebody who does not
-- already hold 'admin' or 'internal' would lock them out rather than let them
-- in, and the 403 says nothing about roles.
--
-- The function is rewritten in full rather than altered. A plpgsql body is
-- text, resolved at runtime, so nothing about it follows a change made
-- elsewhere -- the same property that made 000103's table rename need an
-- explicit CREATE OR REPLACE of the trigger function it did not appear to
-- touch. Everything here is 000007's body verbatim except the two added
-- names; the EXTERNAL branch and the SYSTEM precedence are unchanged.

-- Backfill, for anyone already holding one of the two roles when this runs.
--
-- Narrow on purpose, unlike 000007's own whole-table backfill. This change
-- only ADDS names to the INTERNAL branch, so no user can move away from
-- INTERNAL by it -- only towards. That makes "holds a rota admin role and is
-- not already INTERNAL" the complete set of rows whose derived value changed,
-- and rewriting the other few thousand would be churn with no result.
--
-- is_system_user is checked the way the CASE above checks it: SYSTEM wins over
-- every role, and IS NOT TRUE (rather than = FALSE) keeps a NULL falling
-- through to the role branches exactly as the CASE does.
--
-- This UPDATE does not re-enter the trigger it looks like it might:
-- users_is_system_user_change is AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE **OF is_system_user**,
-- and this writes user_type only.
